# Resilient RP Rulebook

## Built by the Players, for the Players

Resilient RP was created to give players something real a city that feels alive, unpredictable, and shaped by the stories we build together.  
Every win, loss, and mistake should add to the experience not take away from it.

This community thrives on creativity, fairness, and respect.  
We don’t believe in punishing people for losing a shootout or a chase.  
We believe in rewarding great roleplay, collaboration, and effort.  

Our staff team exists to **protect the experience**, not control it.  
We act when someone’s actions break immersion, harm others, or take away from the fun.  
The goal is simple keep the world fair, immersive, and player-driven.
At its core, **Resilient RP is built by the players, for the players.**  
Every system, rule, and guideline exists to give you freedom not limit it.

## Community Standards

### Respect & Conduct
- Treat everyone with respect — in and out of character.  
  This includes players, staff, and the wider community.
- Discrimination, hate speech, or bigotry of any kind is never acceptable.  
  “It’s just RP” is **not** an excuse.
- Harassment, stalking, threats, or targeted bullying on any platform will lead to removal.

### Off-Server Behavior
- What happens outside the city can still impact it.  
  Harassment, doxxing, or smear campaigns that create a hostile environment will be acted on.
- We don’t mediate personal disagreements, but we will protect the safety and trust of our players.
- No advertisement of other servers within Resilient RP chats, discords, or within the server.

### Feedback & Accountability
- Honest feedback is encouraged.  
  Personal attacks, public harassment, or targeted negativity are not.
- Reports involving staff are reviewed independently to ensure fairness.

### Adult Community
- Resilient RP is **18+ only.**  
  Mature conversations and themes are fine — harassment and discomfort are not.

### Appeals & Disputes
- If you’re banned, you can appeal through our ticket system.  
  A separate staff member will handle your case for transparency.

### Alts & Ban Evasion
- Alternate accounts must be disclosed.  
  Evading punishments or spying through alts is a permanent ban.

### Naming & Profiles
- Character names, usernames, and profile content must follow community standards.  
  No impersonation, sexual, or troll-based content anywhere in our ecosystem.

### Leave Drama at the Door
- You don’t have to like everyone, but you do have to act like an adult.  
  Constant negativity, OOC conflict, or drama will not be tolerated.

## In-Game Conduct

### Roleplay First
- Always remain in character while in the city.  
  Every scene civilian, criminal, or law enforcement should contribute to the story and immersion.
- If someone offers you RP, reciprocate.  
  Grinding, crafting, or ignoring interaction breaks the purpose of the city.
- Everyone shares responsibility for building good scenes.

### In-Game Harassment
- Conflict is part of RP. Harassment is not.  
  Using RP to target someone OOCly is unacceptable.
- Harassment includes:
  - Repeatedly inserting into another player’s story without purpose.  
  - Using multiple characters to provoke or follow the same player.  
  - Ignoring boundaries or clear attempts to disengage.

Staff assess intent, pattern, and respect for boundaries when handling reports.  
False harassment claims to avoid IC consequences will result in discipline.

### Breaking Character
- Don’t break character mid-scene.  
  Avoid saying “RDM,” “FailRP,” or similar OOC phrases.  
  Handle reports afterward unless it involves hate speech or explicit content.

### Exploiting & Glitch Abuse
- Don’t abuse bugs, loopholes, or unintended mechanics. Report them immediately.
- Exploit examples:
  - Duplicating items or money.
  - Animation or emote abuse in combat.
  - Logging out to avoid arrest or death (combat logging).
  - Using respawn mechanics to skip police or medical RP.
- Use of any game modification that changes the functionality of your game is not permitted to be used: including PVP sound packs, no recoil, no shadows.

### Value of Life (NVL)
- Always act as though your character values their life and relationships.  
  Charging into armed situations or ignoring danger is NVL unless you plan permanent consequences.

### Metagaming
- Do not use OOC information in character.  
  This includes Discord messages, streams, or off-server chats.
- Don’t communicate about in-character events through 3rd-party voice apps while in the server.
- Do not watch or use live streams to gain information in-character.

### Powergaming
- Do not force outcomes or deny players agency.  
  Example:  
  ❌ `/me slits throat and leaves`  
  ✅ `/me raises the knife, attempting to harm them`
- You can control your actions, not the result.

### Fail RP
- Your character should act and look believable within the city world.  
  Trolling, meme outfits, or low-effort RP are not allowed.  

### Copyrighted Music
- Avoid playing copyrighted music in public spaces to protect streamers.

### Server Events
- Do not interrupt or grief city-wide events unless cleared by staff.  
  Events take planning — respect the effort that goes into them.

## Government & Allowlisted Roles

- Government roles must use authority fairly. 
- Repeatedly targeting groups or individuals OOCly is prohibited.  
- Don’t sabotage departments because of OOC disagreements.
- Selling, trading, or giving away job-exclusive items (e.g., PD gear, medical tools) is forbidden (unless cleared by staff).
- If unsure whether your RP idea is appropriate, open a ticket and ask.

## Conflict & Crime Rules

### Roleplay Over Gunplay
- Escalate through dialogue and choices before violence.  
  Shootouts should feel earned and story-driven — not random.

### Random Deathmatching (RDM)
- You must give proper initiation and roleplay context before any attack.

### Vehicle Deathmatching (VDM)
- Vehicles may only be used as weapons when there’s no other escape option.

### Camping & Ambushes
- Don’t camp exits, teleport points, or interiors where players have no counterplay.

### Consent-Based RP
- Any extreme or sensitive content (e.g., torture, pregnancy, dismemberment) requires explicit consent from everyone involved.

### Conflict Numbers
- Standard conflict limit: **5v5**
- Police limits follow departmental SOPs.

## Crime Timer
- No major crimes may be initiated **30 minutes before** a scheduled server reset and **30 minutes after** the server reset.
This applies to any crime action that would trigger a large police response or a large-scale dynamic event.
- Petty crimes and small-scale activity that do not require emergency response (e.g., low-level petty crimes, minor fights, small sell transactions).

**Prohibited during timer (examples):**
- Heists 
- High-tier boosts / organized car theft
- Large-scale armed robberies or shootouts
- Kidnappings / abductions that require coordinated police/EMS response
- Mass vehicle chases, blockades, or ambushes meant to cause city-wide disruption

### Endless Conflict
- Conflicts should have development and closure.  
  Constant retaliation without story progression is griefing.

### Conflict Cooldown
- Allow breathing room between major fights, there should be a minimum of 30 minutes between conflicts. 

### Pocket Wiping
- Take only what has value or story relevance (cash, weapons, contraband).  
  Clearing full inventories without reason is bannable.  
  Mid-fight looting for survival is fine — farming is not.

## Injury, Death & Medical RP

### While Downed
- You are **injured, not dead.**  
  Stay in character — no OOC trash talk.  
  Treat injury scenes as part of your story.

### New Life Rule (NLR)
- If executed in an RP scene:
  - You forget identifying details (names, voices, tattoos, etc.).
  - You may not remember anything 30 minutes prior to you getting back on your feet.
- Treat it as a hazy memory — if they wanted you to remember, they’d have left you alive.

### Ocean Dumping
- Dumping a body is valid RP if it serves a story — not to erase evidence or force permadeath.
- Victims may still direct police to where they were originally injured.
- Dumping vehicles or people without RP justification is fail RP.
### Mental Health RP
- All serious Mental Health RP requires staff approval

## Restricted & Sensitive Topics

### No Erotic Roleplay
- Explicit sexual RP is not allowed anywhere — voice, text, or emotes.

### No Graphic Torture or Gore
- Avoid detailed or extreme violence unless all participants consent.

### No Real-World Tragedy RP
- Do not base stories on real-life trauma or disasters.  
  Topics like suicide, pandemics, or school shootings are off-limits unless explicitly approved by staff and handled responsibly.

## Corruption Roleplay

- Corruption RP must remain **grounded and believable**.  
- Abuse of power for personal gain without consequence is not allowed.
- If you engage in corruption, accept that it may lead to investigation, arrest, or removal from your role.
- When in doubt, open a ticket.

## Enforcement & Expectations
- Rules are enforced based on **intent, context, and community impact**, not technical loopholes.  
- Mistakes happen, genuine mistakes often lead to coaching, not punishment.
- Repeat, malicious, or community-harming behavior will result in permanent removal.
- Staff decisions are guided by one principle: **protecting player-driven RP**.

## Final Notes
Resilient RP is a world built on collaboration, creativity, and respect.  
Every rule here exists to make sure your story — and everyone else’s — can thrive.  
Stay true to the spirit of RP, value the people you share scenes with, and help us keep the city vibrant, fair, and fun.

**Built by the players. For the players. Always.**
